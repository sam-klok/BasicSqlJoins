Here I decided to create repository of some basic queries and joints.
Despite simplicity, some of them could be tricky.

Images in the root have some parts of tasks.

Note: I may use various databases for playing with them, like Adventure works, or some custome database in the Azure cloud,
so please adjust name in the "use <database_name>" if needed. 

FYI: There are init SQL to create tables with data.

thank you
